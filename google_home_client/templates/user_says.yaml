# give-color-intent:

#  UserSays:
#    - My color is blue
#    - red is my favorite color

#  Annotations:
#    - blue: sys.color     # maps param value -> entity
#    - red: sys.color

#  Events:
#    - event1              # adds a triggerable event named 'event1' to the intent


# right now, the only way to trigger the app is by saying "Hey Google, talk to my test app"
# need to fix this so that we don't need to go through the extra dialog
